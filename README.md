# Campaign--Fundraiser/ CornerStone
<Strong>This is the start of a fundraising application powered by React and Smart contracts. To make a 2.0 version of kickstarter putting more control into the hands of the
investors to ensure projects get completed and the angels can feel assured that there investments are well spent. The basics were freom a solidity class by Stephen Grider
and it was expanded upon by myself. The project when done will have multiple blockchains that the makers or inventor can choose to use using noty only solidity but Reach
and Plutus as well. I want to create a platform to help peoples dream business or invention come true and provide a safer platform for the generous people who want to 
help these people succede.</Strong>
